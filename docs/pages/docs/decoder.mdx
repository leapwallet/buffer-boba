title: "Decoder"
---

The primary purpose of the library is to decode the SignDoc received from dApps. We provide a couple of ways to do so.

## DirectSignDocDecoder

This class is the simplest way to decode a SignDoc. You can use it in the following way:

### get JSON data

```ts
import { DirectSignDocDecoder } from "@leapwallet/buffer-boba";

// signDoc is the SignDoc received from dApps
const signDoc = {}

// decoder is the instance of DirectSignDocDecoder
const decoder = new DirectSignDocDecoder(signDoc);

// decoded to-be txn data
const jsonPayload = decoder.toJSON();
```

Here the argument is a `SignDoc` object defined inside [`cosmos.tx.v1beta1.SignDoc`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/cb1641c1b5f844190723f34db7f73b85c8d43580/proto/cosmos/tx/v1beta1/tx.proto#L49). It looks like this:

```ts
interface SignDoc {
    /**
     * body_bytes is protobuf serialization of a TxBody that matches the
     * representation in TxRaw.
     */
    bodyBytes: Uint8Array;
    /**
     * auth_info_bytes is a protobuf serialization of an AuthInfo that matches the
     * representation in TxRaw.
     */
    authInfoBytes: Uint8Array;
    /**
     * chain_id is the unique identifier of the chain this transaction targets.
     * It prevents signed transactions from being used on another chain by an
     * attacker
     */
    chainId: string;
    /** account_number is the account number of the account in state */
    accountNumber: Long;
}
```

We have another method called `decode` on the `DirectSignDocDecoder` class which returns the decoded payload as a `Uint8Array`. You can use it in the following way:

```ts
import { DirectSignDocDecoder } from "@leapwallet/buffer-boba";

// signDoc is the SignDoc received from dApps
const signDoc = new Uint8Array([/* ... */]);

// decoder is the instance of DirectSignDocDecoder
const decoder = DirectSignDocDecoder.decodeBytes(signDoc);

// decoded to-be txn data
const jsonPayload = decoder.toJSON();
```

### Methods

#### `constructor`

```ts
constructor(signDoc: SignDoc, protoCodec?: ProtoCodec): DirectSignDocDecoder
```

The constructor takes in a `SignDoc` object and an optional [`ProtoCodec`](./codec) object. The `ProtoCodec` object is used to decode the messages in txBody. If not provided, it will use the `defaultProtoCodec` object.

#### `toJSON`

```ts
toJSON(): { txBody: TxBody, authInfo: AuthInfo, chainId: string, accountNumber: string }
```

This method returns the decoded payload as an object.

#### `decodeBytes`

```ts
static decodeBytes(signDoc: Uint8Array, protoCodec?: ProtoCodec): DirectSignDocDecoder
```

This method takes in a `SignDoc` object as a `Uint8Array` and an optional [`ProtoCodec`](./codec) object. The `ProtoCodec` object is used to decode the messages in txBody. If not provided, it will use the `defaultProtoCodec` object.

#### `toBytes`

```ts
toBytes(): Uint8Array
```

This method returns the SignDoc as a `Uint8Array`.

### Properties

#### `txBody`

```ts
txBody: TxBody
```

This property returns the decoded `TxBody` object.

```ts
/** TxBody is the body of a transaction that all signers sign over. */
interface TxBody {
    /**
     * messages is a list of messages to be executed. The required signers of
     * those messages define the number and order of elements in AuthInfo's
     * signer_infos and Tx's signatures. Each required signer address is added to
     * the list only the first time it occurs.
     * By convention, the first required signer (usually from the first message)
     * is referred to as the primary signer and pays the fee for the whole
     * transaction.
     */
    messages: Any[];
    /**
     * memo is any arbitrary note/comment to be added to the transaction.
     * WARNING: in clients, any publicly exposed text should not be called memo,
     * but should be called `note` instead (see https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/9122).
     */
    memo: string;
    /**
     * timeout is the block height after which this transaction will not
     * be processed by the chain
     */
    timeoutHeight: Long;
    /**
     * extension_options are arbitrary options that can be added by chains
     * when the default options are not sufficient. If any of these are present
     * and can't be handled, the transaction will be rejected
     */
    extensionOptions: Any[];
    /**
     * extension_options are arbitrary options that can be added by chains
     * when the default options are not sufficient. If any of these are present
     * and can't be handled, they will be ignored
     */
    nonCriticalExtensionOptions: Any[];
}
```

#### `txMsgs`

```ts
txMsgs: AnyWithUnpacked[]
```

Returns the messages in the `TxBody` object.

```ts
type Any = {
    typeUrl: string;
    value: Uint8Array;
};

type AnyWithUnpacked = Any | (Any & { unpacked: unknown; toJSON: () => any });
```

Any is a protocol buffer message defined here - https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/any.proto

#### `authInfo`

```ts
authInfo: AuthInfo
```

This property returns the decoded `AuthInfo` object.

```ts
/**
 * AuthInfo describes the fee and signer modes that are used to sign a
 * transaction.
 */
export interface AuthInfo {
    /**
     * signer_infos defines the signing modes for the required signers. The number
     * and order of elements must match the required signers from TxBody's
     * messages. The first element is the primary signer and the one which pays
     * the fee.
     */
    signerInfos: SignerInfo[];
    /**
     * Fee is the fee and gas limit for the transaction. The first signer is the
     * primary signer and the one which pays the fee. The fee can be calculated
     * based on the cost of evaluating the body and doing signature verification
     * of the signers. This can be estimated via simulation.
     */
    fee?: Fee;
}
```

#### `chainId`

```ts
chainId: string
```

This property returns the chain ID.

#### `accountNumber`

```ts
accountNumber: string
```

This property returns the account number.
