title: "Proto Codec"
---

Proto Codec - short of Protocol Buffer codec is basically a mapping for supported message types. It is used to decode protocol buffer messages. It is used alongside [DirectSignDecoder](./decoder).

## `ProtoCodec`

### `Methods`

#### registerType

```ts
registerType(typeUrl: string, generatedType: GeneratedType): void
```

Registers a new message type to the codec. The `typeUrl` is the type url of the message and `generatedType` is a [GeneratedType](https://cosmos.github.io/cosmjs/latest/proto-signing/modules.html#GeneratedType). It basically means, when a message with `typeUrl` is received, the codec will use the `generatedType` to decode the message.


#### unpackAny

```ts
unpackAny(any: Any): AnyWithUnpacked
```

Unpacks an `Any` message. It will return an `AnyWithUnpacked` object which contains the unpacked message and the `typeUrl` of the message. You can access the unpacked message using `message` property and the factory via the related factory property.

This method will return an `UnknownMessage` type if the message is not registered in the codec.

## `ProtoFactory`

A `ProtoFactory` is an interface that is expected by the ProtoCodec in order to decode a message successfully.

```ts
interface ProtoFactory {
  encode: (message: any, writer?: Writer) => Writer
  decode: (r: Reader | Uint8Array, l?: number) => any
  fromJSON: (object: any) => any
  toJSON: (message: any) => any
}
```

## Usage

In order to register a new generated type in the default codec, you need to do the following -

```ts
import { defaultProtoCode } from '@leapwallet/buffer-boba';
import { sdkName } from 'some-library';

defaultProtoCodec.registerProtoFactory(sdkName.someMessage.typeUrl, sdkName.someMessage.generatedType);
```

The `convertToProtoFactory` function will convert the generated message to a `ProtoFactory` that is expected by the codec. Basically, it will add the `fromJSON` and `toJSON` methods to the object.

Now this updated codec can be used in the [DirectSignDecoder](./decoder) to decode the messages in the following manner -
  
```ts
// signDoc is a SignDoc object
// defaultProtoCodec is the updated defaultProtoCodec object
const decoder = new DirectSignDecoder(signDoc, defaultProtoCodec);
```

You can use this decoder for your custom use-cases.

## UnknownMessage

The `UnknownMessage` class is one that implements the Any interface. It represents an unknown message type that cannot be deserialized into a known message type.

### `Constructor`

The UnknownMessage class has a constructor that takes two parameters:

- `_typeUrl`: a string representing the URL of the message type.
- `_value`: a Uint8Array representing the serialized message.

### Getters

The UnknownMessage class has two getters:

- `typeUrl`: a string representing the URL of the message type.
- `value`: a Uint8Array representing the serialized message.

### Methods

#### toJSON

The UnknownMessage class has a toJSON method that returns a JSON representation of the message. It returns an object with two properties:

- `type_url`: a string representing the URL of the message type.
- `value`: a base64-encoded string representing the serialized message.
